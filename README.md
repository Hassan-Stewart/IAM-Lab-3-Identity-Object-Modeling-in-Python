# IAM-Lab-3-Identity-Object-Modeling-in-Python
Overview
This lab introduces identity modeling using Python as part of my IAM/PAM automation learning path. Instead of provisioning users directly in Active Directory, I created identity objects that represent user attributes such as username, department, role, and MFA status. These objects mirror how identity data is structured before being sent to IAM systems like Entra ID, Okta, AWS IAM, and CyberArk.

This lab focuses on building clean, modular Python code that models identity data and prepares it for JSON serialization — a foundational step toward API‑based IAM automation.

# Skills Demonstrated
Python scripting

Identity object modeling

JSON serialization

IAM data structure design

Modular code organization

# Lab Steps
Created Python dictionaries representing user identities

Structured identity attributes (username, department, role, MFA status)

Stored multiple identity objects inside a list

Printed identity records in a readable format

Converted identity objects into JSON using json.dumps()

# Files Included
lab2_identity_objects.py – Contains identity objects

lab3_json_payload.py – Converts identity objects into JSON

# Screenshots
You will add:

Terminal output of identity objects

JSON payload output

VS Code file structure

# Lessons Learned
How identity data is represented before provisioning

How JSON payloads are prepared for IAM APIs

How modular Python files improve automation structure

How identity attributes map to real IAM systems
